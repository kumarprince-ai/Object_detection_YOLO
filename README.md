Object Detection using MobileNetV2 in TensorFlow 2.0

This repository contains code for object detection using the MobileNetV2 model in TensorFlow 2.0.

Requirements:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.0+
Usage:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-mobilenetv2.git
Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the object detection script:
python object_detection.py
The script will load the MobileNetV2 model and perform object detection on the image specified in the img_path variable. The script will then print the predicted classes and their confidence scores to the console.

Example output:

Car: 0.95
Jeep: 0.03
Truck: 0.01
Bike: 0.00
cycle: 0.00
This output shows that the model is confident that the image contains a car. The model also predicts that the image may contain a jeep or truck, but the probabilities are much lower. The model predicts that the image is unlikely to contain a bike or cycle.

Customizing the model:

You can customize the model to detect different objects by changing the class_labels variable. The class_labels variable is a list of strings, where each string represents the name of a class that the model should be able to detect.

You can also train the model on your own custom dataset. To do this, you will need to create a dataset of images that are labeled with the objects that you want the model to be able to detect. You can then use the TensorFlow Object Detection API to train the model on your custom dataset.

Conclusion:

This repository provides a simple and easy-to-use way to perform object detection using the MobileNetV2 model in TensorFlow 2.0. You can customize the model to detect different objects and train it on your own custom dataset.
